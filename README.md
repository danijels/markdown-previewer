# Markdown Previewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built based off the [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO) and [requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) by freeCodeCamp.

See live on [Markdown Previewer](https://danijels.github.io/markdown-previewer)

- On the first load the editor is filled with representations of a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text
- User can enter GitHub flavored markdown into the editor field and have it rendered as HTML in the previewer field
- Both fields can be maximized
